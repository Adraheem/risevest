## Concerns
Although, the assessment was awesome and interesting, but it came with some challenges such as:
- Figma Design: The design is intuitive and welcoming, more importantly is the user flow which was not indicated correctly/completely in the design leaving some screens unreachable.
- API: The API is easy to consume and work with, but for someone outside the organization, some terms still need more clarification. E.g `invested_amount`, `total_returns` and `target_amount`. It would have been easy to implicitly determine what they all stand for if there's a clear relationship with the `target_amount` during the plan creating process.
